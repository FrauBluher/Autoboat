# Electronics Mounting Board

This directory contains Solidworks 2012 CAD files for a mounting board for the various onboard electronics onboard the boat. It fits inside a Wiegmann BN4161406SS electronics box. This includes a large capacitor, 3 CAN nodes providing various functions, and an ACS300 brushless DC motor driver board. Some screw terminal blocks also have mounting holes (they're all from Blue Sea Systems).

It was designed to be cut out of a non-conductive 1/4" material. The Corel Draw DXF file is included for use with a laser cutter.

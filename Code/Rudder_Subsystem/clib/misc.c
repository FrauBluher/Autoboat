 * This function restored the calibrated range for the RC receiver PWM signals if any exist.
 * Since the EEPROM is initialized to 0xFFFF for each uint16 we only restore the values if
 * the memory locations that should contain our data just contain 0xFFFF instead. restoredCalibration
 * is another exported global that is just a Boolean for whether or not we restored saved data. This
 * is used to correct the calibration state used elsewhere.

/**
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This library contains a message dispatcher for use with MAVLink. It allows for repeated and
 * one-off messages to be smartly allocated during all the possible timesteps for transmission.
 * This reduces bursting and minimizes problems with buffer overflow.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * This library requires MAVLink's primary 'mavlink.h' to be accessible.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * 1) Set your code to call IncrementTimestep() at 100Hz and to process the list of message IDs.
 * 2) Add an initialization function to add all desired repeating messages using AddMessage().
 * 3) Add support for a heap (probably at least 512). This library relies on malloc() and free(). 
 * 4) That's it! If you'd like to change the dispatched messages you may at any time.
 *
 * TESTING:
 * A unit-testing framework is built-in to this library and available by running with the UNIT_TEST
 * preprocessor macro defined. For example: 
 *   `gcc MavlinkMessageScheduler.c -DUNIT_TEST -g -lm`
